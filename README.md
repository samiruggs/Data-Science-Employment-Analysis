## 1. Project Overview  
**Stakeholder:** A mid-sized technology company (hypothetical).  

**Business Problem:**  
The company I call â€˜LifeTech Inc.â€™ struggles to attract and retain top data professionals. Job offers are frequently rejected, and leadership suspects their salary and remote work policies are not aligned with market standards.  

**Goal:**  
Analyze global salary trends, job demand, and the impact of remote work using a real-world dataset. Provide actionable recommendations for competitive compensation and hiring strategies.

## 2. Data Sources  
- **Primary Dataset:** Data Science Job Salaries (2020â€“2022)  
- **Records:** 606 rows  
- **Features:** 12 columns (job title, experience level, salary in USD, company location, employee residence, company size, remote ratio, employment type, etc.)  
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Data Science Job Salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)

## 3. Tools Used  
- **Google Sheets** â†’ Data cleaning, preparation, feature engineering  
- **Tableau Public** â†’ Exploratory analysis & interactive dashboard  
- **GitHub** â†’ Documentation, dataset storage, and sharing dashboard links

## 4. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Sheets)  
Steps taken in Google Sheets:  

1. **Removed unnecessary column**  
   - Dropped index column `F1`  
2. **Standardized text**  
   - Used `=PROPER()` to ensure consistent formatting for job titles and experience levels  
3. **Created new feature: Remote Work Type**  
   ```excel
   =IFS(C2=0,"On-Site",C2=50,"Hybrid",C2=100,"Fully Remote")

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (Tableau)

Interactive visualizations were built in Tableau Public to explore key aspects of the data science job market:

- **Top 5 Job Titles:** Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst
- **Top 5 Employee Residences:** US, GB, CA, IN, DE
- **Employment Type:** Full-Time dominated (422/429 employees)
- **Salary by Experience Level:**
  - Entry â†’ ~$60k
  - Intermediate â†’ ~$93k
  - Senior â†’ ~$133k
  - Expert â†’ $200k+

- Entry-Role -> $80k+

**Remote Work Premium:**
- Fully Remote roles command higher pay compared to hybrid

**Job Title Salaries:**
The top 5 earners in the Job Title category are 
- Research Scientist
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Data Engineer salaries
- Data Scientist
- Data Analyst

**Geographic Distribution:**
- US holds ~70% of employees
- UK, Canada, India, Germany are significant talent hubs

---

### 7. Results & Findings

1. **Competitive Salaries:** Senior data roles require $150kâ€“$180k salaries to stay competitive
2. **Remote-First Norm:** Remote/hybrid hiring is now the industry standard
3. **Global Talent Availability:** Strong talent pools outside the US (UK, CA, IN, DE)
4. **Job Title Clarity:** Recognizable titles (Data Scientist, ML Engineer) improve visibility and hiring success

---

### 8. Recommendations

âœ… **Revise Salary Bands** â†’ Offer $150kâ€“$180k for senior roles; $200k+ for expert roles  
âœ… **Adopt Remote-First Hiring** â†’ Expand hiring beyond local geographies  
âœ… **Standardize Job Titles** â†’ Use market-recognized titles (e.g., Senior Data Engineer)  
âœ… **Tap Global Talent** â†’ Pilot remote hires in UK, Canada, India

### 9. Limitations

- Salaries are self-reported (possible bias)
- Dataset covers only 2020â€“2022 (market may have shifted since then)
- Currency & cost-of-living differences not accounted for
- Limited records for Expert-level roles (only 6 entries)
