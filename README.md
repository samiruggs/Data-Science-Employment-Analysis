## 1. Project Overview  

**Stakeholder:** LifeTech Inc. *(Hypothetical Mid-Sized US Tech Company)*  

**Business Problem:**  
LifeTech is facing challenges in **hiring and retaining top data talent**. Job offers are frequently rejected, and many candidates demand salaries higher than current ranges. At the same time, the company wants to **scale operations without proportionally scaling costs**.  

**Project Goal:**  
Analyze global salary trends, job title demand, and the role of remote work using **Google Sheets for preparation** and **Tableau for visualization**. The objective is to deliver **scalable hiring insights** that balance competitiveness with cost efficiency.

## 2. Data Sources  

- **Primary Dataset:** `ds_salaries.csv`  
- **Size:** 606 records, 12 columns  
- **Features:** job title, experience level, employee residence, company location, company size, salary in USD, remote ratio, employment type  
- **Timeframe:** 2020â€“2022  
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Data Science Job Salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)

## 3. Tools Used  

- **Google Sheets** â†’ Data cleaning, filtering, and feature creation  
- **Tableau Public** â†’ Exploratory data analysis, interactive dashboard, visual insights  
- **GitHub** â†’ Documentation and project repository  

---

## 4. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Sheets)  

Steps taken in Google Sheets:  

- **Removed Unnecessary Columns** â†’ Dropped index column (`F1`)  
- **Standardized Text** â†’ Used `=PROPER()` on job titles & experience levels to standardize text.
- I used Aliases in Tableau to change the elements of the remote ratio column from 0, 50, 100 to "Onsite", "Hybrid" and "Remote"
- I used count(ds_salaries) to ascertain the number of representations in each category

### 6. Data Analysis

<img width="999" height="799" alt="Dashboard 1 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/752869e9-8a21-4be0-a299-4f6dabf18222" />

 
**Salary Benchmarks (US):**
- Senior roles â†’ $150kâ€“$165k
- Expert-level roles â†’ $200k+
- Entry-Role -> $90k+

**Remote Work Premium:**
- Fully Remote roles command higher pay compared to hybrid

**Job Title Salaries:**
The top 5 earners in the Job Title category are 
- Research Scientist
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer
- Data Analyst

**Geographic Distribution:**
- US holds ~96% of employees
- UK, Canada, India, Germany are significant talent hubs

---

### 7. Results & Findings

1. **Competitive Salaries:** Senior data roles require $150kâ€“$180k salaries to stay competitive
2. **Remote-First Norm:** Remote/hybrid hiring is now the industry standard
3. **Global Talent Availability:** Strong talent pools outside the US (UK, CA, IN, DE)
4. **Job Title Clarity:** Recognizable titles (Data Scientist, ML Engineer) improve visibility and hiring success

---

### 8. Recommendations

âœ… **Revise Salary Bands** â†’ Offer $150kâ€“$180k for senior roles; $200k+ for expert roles  
âœ… **Adopt Remote-First Hiring** â†’ Expand hiring beyond local geographies  
âœ… **Standardize Job Titles** â†’ Use market-recognized titles (e.g., Senior Data Engineer)  
âœ… **Tap Global Talent** â†’ Pilot remote hires in UK, Canada, India and Nigeria 

---

### 9. Limitations

- Salaries are self-reported (possible bias)
- Dataset covers only 2020â€“2022 (market may have shifted since then)
- Currency & cost-of-living differences not accounted for
- Limited records for Expert-level roles (only 6 entries)
- Most employees that were surveyed based in the US (about 260) from a sample of 606 hence a selection bias.
